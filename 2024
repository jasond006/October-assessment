# question 1 

print("This program can find the perimeter or area of a quadrilateral") #(i) explaining the program 

length = float(input("Please enter the length: "))
width = float(input("Please enter the width: ")) #(iii) asking the user to input the width and length of the quadrilateral

name = input("Enter your user name: ") #(ii) asking the user's name

choice = input("Do you want to find the (p)erimeter or the (a)rea? : ")
if choice == "p":
    perimeter =2*(length) + 2*(width) #(vi) changing the formula for the perimeter
    print("A quadrilateral with a length of" , length , "and a width of" , width , "has a perimeter of " , round(perimeter , 2)) #(v) making the output more informative
elif choice == "a":
    area = (length*width)
    print("A quadrilateral with a length of" , length , "and a width of" , width , "has an area of " , round(area , 2)) #(iv) rounding the output to 2 deicmal places
    
print("Thank you for using the program " , name) #(ii)

sales()#calling the function so it can do the maths and print the total revenue
